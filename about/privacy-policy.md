## Definitions

References in this document to "Skewed Ventures", "CloudSkew", "we", "us" or "our" are references to
`Skewed Ventures Private Ltd (CIN: U74999KA2017PTC102832)`, a company incorporated in Karnataka,
India with its registered office at `#175 and #176, Dollars Colony, Phase 4, JP Nagar, Bannerghatta Main Road, Bengaluru 560076, Karnataka, India` and
operating as `cloudskew.com`.

The terms "you", "your", "user" are references to visitors to our [landing page](https://www.cloudskew.com/) or users of our [online diagram editor](https://app.cloudskew.com/) i.e. our "services".

## Data Collection, Usage & Retention

When a user interacts with CloudSkew's [landing page](https://www.cloudskew.com/) or [diagram editor](https://app.cloudskew.com/) some information is captured, used & retained as specified below:

### Personal information

#### Email Address

When a user logs in to the CloudSkew diagram editor, the user's email address is collected via [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) (CloudSkew's identity provider). No passwords are generated, collected, or stored during the login/signup process. Also, CloudSkew does not collect or store any other contact details like postal address, phone number, etc.

A user's email address is only required for uniquely identifying the user in CloudSkew's system. In the rare event of a catastrophic data loss or data breach, CloudSkew will use these email addresses to notify affected users.

CloudSkew will never send any newsletters or marketing/promotional materials via email. CloudSkew will never share a user's email address with any external party.

### Usage information

#### Cookies

CloudSkew's landing page and diagram editor do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or beacons. Auth0, the identity provider used by CloudSkew, uses cookies (please refer to [Auth0's privacy and cookie policy](https://auth0.com/privacy) for more details). Auth0's cookies are removed from a user's machine when the user logs out of the CloudSkew diagram editor.

#### Google Analytics

CloudSkew uses Google Analytics to analyze website traffic and make any necessary product improvements & optimizations. The data collected by Google Analytics may include information about users' device, browser, IP address, timezone, referring/exit pages, and timestamps. However, all the data collected is anonymized, PII-free, and retained indefinitely on Google's servers (please refer to [Google Analytics' policies & terms of usage](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/4597324?hl=en) for more details).

#### Azure Application Insights

The CloudSkew diagram editor uses [Azure Application Insights SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to extract some user-insights and make necessary improvements in the product.

For E.g. We're interested in tracking the names of icons that the users couldn't find in the icon palette (via the icon search box). This helps us add these frequently searched icons into the palette later on. Again, all the data collected is anonymized, PII-free, and retained for 90 days.

### User content

TBD

## Changes

CloudSkew may update this privacy policy from time to time (to reflect changes to our practices or for other operational, legal & regulatory reasons). CloudSkew will notify users of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page (users are encouraged to periodically review this page for the latest changes). For any major/prominent changes, a notice will be put up on our site before the changes become active.
