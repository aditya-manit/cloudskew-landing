# Terms of Service

## Definitions

In this document, the terms "Skewed Ventures", "CloudSkew", "we", "us" or "our" refer to
Skewed Ventures Private Ltd (CIN: U74999KA2017PTC102832), a company incorporated in Karnataka,
India with its registered office at #175 and #176, Dollars Colony, Phase 4, JP Nagar, Bannerghatta Main Road, Bengaluru 560076, Karnataka, India and
operating as cloudskew.com.

The terms "you", "your", "user" refer to visitors to our [landing page](https://www.cloudskew.com/) or users of our [online diagram editor](https://app.cloudskew.com/) i.e. our "services".

## Accepting the Terms

By using CloudSkew's services, the user agrees to and accepts CloudSkew's terms of service described in this document.

Users may not use CloudSkew's services if they do not agree to or accept the terms of service.

## Privacy and Personal Information

The manner in which CloudSkew handles users' privacy and personal information is stipulated in our [Privacy Policy](./privacy-policy.md) page.

## Payments

A valid payment method is required to upgrade from a free subscription to a paid subscription. Currently, only credit & debit cards from Visa & Mastercard are the accepted payment methods.

The paid subscriptions are prepaid, non-refundable, annual subscriptions.

All fees are exclusive of taxes, levies, and duties imposed by taxing authorities. CloudSkew users will be solely responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies,
or duties.

Users should notify CloudSkew (by emailing support@cloudskew.com) about any billing problems or discrepancies within 30 days of purchasing the paid subscription, else they waive their right to dispute the charges.

## Renewals

At the end of the user's annual billing cycle, CloudSkew will auto-renew the user's paid subscription by charging the previously used payment method. Users are encouraged to keep their payment details updated (credit card numbers, expiry date, billing address, etc) via the in-app billing portal.

If the auto-renewal of a user's paid subscription fails, CloudSkew will attempt 4 more times to auto-renew before downgrading it to a free subscription (i.e effectively canceling the paid subscription).

## Price Changes

CloudSkew reserves the right to change the prices of paid subscriptions at any time. Details on the pricing changes will be posted to CloudSkew's site. The new pricing will be effective for the next billing cycle .i.e. during renewal (and will not impact the current billing cycle).

## Cancellation and Refunds

Users are solely responsible for properly canceling their paid subscriptions, which they can do at any time by emailing us at support@cloudskew.com. As a security precaution, CloudSkew requires that users email us from their registered email address. CloudSkew will reply with a confirmation email within 24 hours of receiving this request.

Since CloudSkew users prepay for non-refundable, annual subscriptions, the user's paid subscription remains active until the end of their current billing cycle, after which it will be canceled (i.e. will not be renewed and the user will not be charged again). Cancellation of a paid subscription involves it being downgraded to the free subscription (note: limits applicable to a free subscription will be enforced). Users may continue to use CloudSkew's services under a free subscription and upgrade to a paid subscription at any time.

CloudSkew does not provide refunds on paid subscriptions.
