## Available features

:heavy_check_mark: The following features are available in CloudSkew right now (see [release notes](https://github.com/cloudskew/cloudskew/releases)):

* Save a diagram as a reusable template.
* Document and annotate your diagrams using the built-in document editor.
* Quick access to resource documentation (developer docs, pricing details and SLAs).
* Share your diagrams with others by generating links (viewer don't have to login).

* Adjust z-index of any symbol on the diagram (via context menu).
* Zoom in & out of a diagram.
* Import custom images into a diagram (.png, .jpg formats only, file size must be < 512 KB).
* Any selected symbol's information is displayed via tooltip on hover.
* Attach text labels to any symbol. Labels can be re-positioned, re-sized, rotated and styled (via properties window).
* Optionally enable/disable entire icon families (via preferences/settings bar).

## Planned features

:calendar: In the near team, the following features are on the roadmap (see [planned milestones](https://github.com/cloudskew/cloudskew/milestones)):

* View & adjust z-index of diagram symbols via a separate control.
* Save checkpoints/snapshots (along with ability to restore-from/rollback-to a previous checkpoint).  
* Keyboard shortcuts for commonly performed actions.
* More icons, shapes and diagram templates. You can always request specific ones [here](https://github.com/cloudskew/cloudskew/issues/new/choose). You can view existing open requests [here](https://github.com/cloudskew/cloudskew/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aicon-request).

The relative priorities of these planned features will depend on the volume of user requests received. If you have a feature request that's not listed up here, you can file a new one [here](https://github.com/cloudskew/cloudskew/issues/new/choose).
